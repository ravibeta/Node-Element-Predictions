# Node-Element-Predictions
This is a vector-store based semantic search for drone positions as an alternative to Self-Organized Map (https://github.com/raja0034/som4drones)
An alternative would be to estimate the vehicle position in state space representation such that the position is derived from the position and velocity at current time and expected velocity at the future time step.
